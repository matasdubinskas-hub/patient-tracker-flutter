## 🔧 **STEP 1: Set Up macOS Environment**

Since you're on Windows, you need a Mac environment to build iOS apps. Here are your options:

### **Option A: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended - Cheapest)**
**Cost**: ~$0.18/hour (only when building)

1. **Create GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   # In your current directory
   git init
   git add ios_native/
   git commit -m "Native iOS Patient Tracker app"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/patient-tracker-ios.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create Codespace**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on main"
   - Choose **macOS** as the machine type
   - Wait for setup (5-10 minutes)

### **Option B: MacStadium Cloud Mac**
**Cost**: ~$79/month
- Professional dedicated Mac mini
- Sign up at macstadium.com
- Choose Mac mini plan
- Connect via Remote Desktop

### **Option C: Rent-a-Mac Services**
**Cost**: ~$30-50/month
- MacInCloud.com
- MacStadium hourly plans
- AWS EC2 Mac instances

# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Verify installation
xcode-select -p
# Should show: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

# Accept Xcode license
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

## 📱 **STEP 3: Set Up Your iOS Project**

1. **Download Your Native iOS Code**:
   ```bash
   # Clone your repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patient-tracker-ios.git
   cd patient-tracker-ios
   ```

2. **Open in Xcode**:
   ```bash
   # Create Xcode project (you'll need to do this in Xcode)
   # Or copy the files into a new Xcode project
   open -a Xcode
   ```

3. **Create New Xcode Project**:
   - File → New → Project
   - Choose "iOS" → "App"
   - Product Name: `Patient Tracker`
   - Bundle ID: `com.yourname.patienttracker`
   - Language: Swift
   - Use Core Data: ✅ Check this

4. **Replace Generated Files**:
   - Copy all files from `ios_native/PatientTracker/` into your Xcode project
   - Replace the generated files with your converted ones
